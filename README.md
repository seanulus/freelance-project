# Freelance Web Project

## By Sean McDermott

# Description
This is the CSS/Design Week Two code review. Our goal is to create sketches, wireframes and prototypes for a new cowork space opening in the area based on criteria from our client.

#Sketches

#Screenshots

# Specifications
* Online presence mirrors their in-person presence, attracting the people who would enjoy the workspace.

* Site feels luxurious, cool and high-end yet still welcoming, approachable and inclusive. Safe, comfortable and productive.

* A unique feel that sets them apart from other companies offering similar services. Funky, local, less-corporate, more fun.

* Avoid catering solely to tech. Artists, daytraders, writers, counselors, traditional business people. Diversity.

* Easy to see the amenities offered in the space. On site coffee, communal and private offices, high-speed internet, printing/faxing, optional fun activity on Thursdays (yoga, complimentary food, craft)

#Brainstorming

* We are a company committed to fostering creativity. We believe our core values apply to every aspect of life and invite anyone that feels the same way to connect with us. Designed to provide a nurturing space for creativity and inspiration for every individual.

* Use entrance photo on main page to give a feeling of openness and opportunity. A welcoming atmosphere for all types of creative people.

* Include an about section detailing the core values listed above. A section including what services are offered and tie them into said core values. This company cares about the people who utilize their space.

* Give the company a different feel than similar companies. Since they are trying to cater to artists as well as business and tech, try using an interesting but palpable color scheme that caters to everyone who might use the space.
