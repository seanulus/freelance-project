# Freelance Web Project

## By Sean McDermott

# Description
This is the CSS/Design Week Two code review. Our goal is to create sketches, wireframes and prototypes for a new cowork space opening in the area based on criteria from our client.

#Sketches

#Screenshots

# Specifications
* Online presence mirrors their in-person presence, attracting the people who would enjoy the workspace.

* Site feels luxurious, cool and high-end yet still welcoming, approachable and inclusive. Safe, comfortable and productive.

* A unique feel that sets them apart from other companies offering similar services. Funky, local, less-corporate, more fun.

* Avoid catering solely to tech. Artists, daytraders, writers, counselors, traditional business people. Diversity.

* Easy to see the amenities offered in the space. On site coffee, communal and private offices, high-speed internet, printing/faxing, optional fun activity on Thursdays (yoga, complimentary food, craft)
